                <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Robotics projects E-YANTRA ROBOTICS COMPETITION - IIT BOMBAY</h3>
                <p>• E-Yantra Artificial Nurse - Year: 2015: Al nurse agent built to collect multiple requests
                    from multiple patients in hospital and serving them real-time prioritizing serving
                    sequences based on shortest distance and request priorities using Dijkstra's algorithm
                    for shortest distance and image processing for path direction on arena - won 6th
                    position all over India, in E-Yantra robotics competition by IIT.
                    • Automated real-time Border Security System - Year: 2016: Implementation of Al agents
                    to real time monitor and detect for enemy/intruder on complex arena and alerting to
                    control system on spotting an enemy or shooting them on automatic/manual mode in
                    critical.

                <h3>IIB & Middleware projects TCS: CLIENT - RAC VEHICLE INSURANCE (UK)</h3>
                <p>• IIB V8 to v10 migration - Year: 2018: Implementation of all existing IIB interfaces &
                    restoring IIB and MQ setup for migrated IIB V.10.
                    • Implementation of dual pointing setups in case of 3rd party version migrations:
                    Providing set of s to point different versions of 3rd party environments as per need of
                    
                    connection, this was needed by multiple 3rd parties when they were going through
                    migration and has need of pointing single or both new and old version of environments
                    on same time).
                    • Automation tasks to reduce 1-2 hours of BAU efforts by team: Automated list of various
                    time - taking BAU and monitoring tasks, which were taking 1-2 hours of hectic efforts
                    daily, also there was high chances of manual mistakes, now automation does it in 5
                    minutes with 100% accuracy.
                    • Multiple IIB applications for various requirements by clients using broker tools, web
                    services (SOAP & REST), RDBMS, share point, JDBC, ODBC, SFTP, etc.</p>
